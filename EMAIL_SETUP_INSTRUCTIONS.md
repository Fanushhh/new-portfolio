### IMPORTANT: Template Settings
Make sure your EmailJS template settings are configured as follows:

1. **To Email**: Set to `{{to_email}}` or manually enter your email
2. **From Name**: Set to `{{from_name}}`
3. **From Email**: Use your verified email service (not `{{from_email}}`)
4. **Reply To**: Set to `{{reply_to}}` so replies go to the form submitter

4. **Note down your Template ID** (you'll need this later)

## Step 4: Get Your User ID

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```javascript
const EMAIL_CONFIG = {
    USER_ID: 'your_actual_user_id_here',
    SERVICE_ID: 'your_actual_service_id_here',
    TEMPLATE_ID: 'your_actual_template_id_here'
};
```
